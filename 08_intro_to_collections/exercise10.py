# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. 
# Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.
names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# no, sets are unordered, so regardless of how you construct them, you cannot
# trust that they will maintain any particular order
