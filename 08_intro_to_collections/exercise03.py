# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at 
# least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

# - lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable
# - lists are unhashable, whereas tuples are hashable
# - lists and tuples are both sequences. sequences are ordered collections
# that can use numeric indexes to access members
# - lists and tuples are both heterogeneous; elements can be different types
