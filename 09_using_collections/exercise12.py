# Write some code that determines and prints whether the number 3 appears 
# inside each of these lists:

numbers1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]  # True
numbers2 = []                   # False
numbers3 = [2, 4, 6, 8]         # False
numbers4 = ['1', '3', '5']      # False
numbers5 = ['1', 3.0, '5']      # True

# You should print True or False depending on each result.

print(3 in numbers1)
print(3 in numbers2)
print(3 in numbers3)
print(3 in numbers4)
print(3 in numbers5)
